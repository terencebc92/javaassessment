# Java Assessment
A pre-built system (inclusive of codes) was provided but some features were missing in the program.
Our task was to implement missing features in the Student and StudentServices classes to achieve the desired output as outlined in the project requirements.

Features include: 
1) Subscribe student
2) Find student
3) Enroll student to course
4) Show student summary
5) Grade student
6) Show list of passed courses (based on a minimum passing grade)
7) Handle exceptions when a user provides a wrong date format

## What did you like about this project?
I enjoyed the process of understanding the relationship between the classes through the UML diagram. The initial analysis made understanding the system much easier and also reinforced my understanding of inheritance and abstraction. Within the classes, I had to apply my understanding of HashMaps and ArrayLists to achieve the desired outputs, using loops and even converting lists to streams to filter out the list of passed courses.
## What did you struggle with in this project?
I was initially confused with the List syntax as I was mostly practicing with ArrayLists but I  realized that the List is the interface while ArrayList was the implementation of the class of List. So the methods to add new items and find the size were the same.
## What would make your experience with this assessment better?
When I encountered the use of the List class in the code, I replaced it first with HashMaps as that was what I was more familiar working with. Then, I realized it is possible to complete the project using Lists and ArrayLists.  As such, I should have read the documentation about Lists first before making the decision to change the codes to use HashMaps and that could have saved me some time.
